# Generalized Linear Model

## Requirements

### MCMC sampler

The MCMC sampler used to provide a ground-truth comparison uses [pypolyagamma](https://github.com/slinderman/pypolyagamma). Install with

```bash
pip install pypolyagamma
```

Note: On Linux you may first have to `apt-get install libgsl-dev` to get `pypolyagamma` to install correctly.


## Reproducing results and figures

Run:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
in the environment and go through the notebooks in numerical order.
