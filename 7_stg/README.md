# Stomatogastric ganglion - paths in the posterior

### Model

The model is written in cython:

```
pip install cython
```
The simulations were run on a compute cluster. The file 
`results/31D_samples/pyloricsamples_31D_noNaN_3.npz` contains all simulations that did 
not lead to any `NaN` in the summary statistics.

## Reproducing results and figures

Run:
```
jupyter notebook
```
in the environment and go through the notebooks in numerical order.
